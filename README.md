### 📌 **Abstract**  

This research investigates the application of **Deep Learning** techniques for analyzing and classifying emotions from **Albanian speech data**. The study introduces a unique dataset created from recordings of **9 native speakers** expressing four primary emotions: **Happy, Sad, Angry, and Surprised**. Advanced deep learning architectures such as **ResNet50** and **Xception** were implemented to achieve significant accuracy in emotion recognition tasks.

### 🧠 **Highlights**  

- **Custom Dataset:** Collected from 9 native Albanian speakers, each expressing 4 distinct emotions across multiple sentences.  
- **Deep Learning Models:** Implemented ResNet50 and Xception architectures to classify emotional states from mel spectrograms.  
- **Key Findings:** Demonstrated the potential of deep learning for emotion recognition in underrepresented languages like Albanian.
